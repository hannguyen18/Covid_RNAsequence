## Covid_RNAsequence

Analyze the data on RNA sequences of COVID in two of its major variants: Delta and Omicron. RNA is a nucleic acid present in any living cell that has one strand consisting of various combinations of four nucleotides: uracil, cytosine, adenine, and guanine. RNA is the "source code" for COVID that enables the virus to enter the cell and replicate itself.

We'll be using the available data from NIH (National Institutes of Health), the federal government agency in the U.S. You can download the dataset containing the metadata for each COVID RNA sequence and look at its documentation here (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/docs/v1/reference-docs/data-packages/sars-cov-2-genome/).
